# hello-sdl2-android-ios

This is a simple bootstrap project to start using SDL in Android and iOS with CMake

## Android
This project is an update of the hello world project here https://github.com/stephen47/android-sdl2-gradle-template, as I couldn't find a good way to integrate a CMake built C++ project to an android application.
It features a sample hello world using SDL and SDL_image.

The project has now been restructured to use a simple flow. To use it, simply open `android` as a project in Android Studio. Compiling and running should work out of the box.

## iOS
The setup was inspired from https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/52_hello_mobile/ios_mac/index.php
